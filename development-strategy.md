# Content Writing Agentic AI System - Development Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic approach for building a multi-agent content writing system using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and modern agentic frameworks. The system consists of four specialized agents (Research, Strategy, Writer, Editor) working with various tools to create high-quality content through autonomous decision-making and collaborative workflows.

## Architecture Philosophy

**Agentic Framework Integration**: Leverage proven agentic frameworks for agent orchestration, planning, and execution.

**Build Foundation First**: Start with core infrastructure and individual tools before building complex agent interactions.

**Incremental Value**: Each phase should deliver working functionality that can be tested and validated.

**Dependencies-First**: Build dependencies before dependents (tools before agents, simple agents before complex ones).

## Agentic Framework Selection

### Primary Frameworks

#### CrewAI
- **Use Case**: Multi-agent collaboration and workflow orchestration
- **Why**: Excellent for role-based agent teams, built-in collaboration patterns
- **Integration**: Agent coordination, task delegation, workflow management

#### LangGraph
- **Use Case**: Complex workflow orchestration with conditional logic
- **Why**: State management, graph-based workflows, error recovery
- **Integration**: Advanced workflow patterns, decision trees, iterative processes

#### AutoGen

- **Why**: Proven multi-agent communication patterns
- **Integration**: Agent-to-agent communication, collaborative problem solving

#### Semantic Kernel (Optional)
- **Use Case**: Enterprise-grade agent orchestration
- **Why**: Microsoft's robust framework with strong governance
- **Integration**: If enterprise deployment is required
